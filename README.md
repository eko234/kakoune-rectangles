# Kakoune Rectangles
sometimes you need to select a portion of text that has the shape of a `R E C T A N G L E`,
but usually you have to press many times `C` or even worse `<a-C>`, with this plugin
you can just turn your main selection into a rectangle quite easily.

## Note
Be mindful that tabs are treated as a single character, thus
if your selection contains lines with different ammount of tabs the produced rectangle will most likely
have a weird length.

## Commands
`rectangle`
